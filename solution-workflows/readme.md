  The Losant Workflow Lab
</h1>

The [Losant Workflow Lab](http://docs.losant.com/workflows/workflow-lab/lab/) is an interactive tool that provides a set of challenges to solve using Losantâ€™s Visual Workflow Engine. The Workflow Lab is intended to be used by both new and experienced users to grow their workflow development skills.

In case you have trouble completing a test in the Workflow Lab, solutions to each test are available on in this folder. If the test solutions do not address your concern, feel free to post a question in the University section of the [Losant Forums](https://forums.losant.com/c/losant-university).
