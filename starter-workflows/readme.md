  The Losant Workflow Lab
</h1>

The [Losant Workflow Lab](http://docs.losant.com/workflows/workflow-lab/lab/) is an interactive tool that provides a set of challenges to solve using Losantâ€™s Visual Workflow Engine. The Workflow Lab is intended to be used by both new and experienced users to grow their workflow development skills.

For each suite, we provide Starter Workflow for each suite to avoid building all of them from the ground up. In order to use these workflows, you must [import](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/overview/#import--export) them into your application.
